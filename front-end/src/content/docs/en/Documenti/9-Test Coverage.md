description: Information on test coverage in the Documenti codebase.

The Documenti project currently lacks dedicated test suites. While the individual components are designed to be functional and robust, there are no automated tests to verify their behavior, interactions, or edge cases. 

Adding comprehensive tests is a crucial step for ensuring the reliability and stability of Documenti. Implementing unit tests for each module, integration tests for component interactions, and end-to-end tests for the entire documentation generation process would significantly enhance the project's quality and maintainability.
