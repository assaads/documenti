## Core Concepts

Documenti is built around the idea of automating code documentation using the power of large language models (LLMs). It aims to simplify and streamline the process of generating comprehensive documentation for software projects.

### AI-Powered Documentation

- **Leveraging LLMs:** Documenti utilizes Google's Gemini AI, a powerful LLM, to understand code and generate human-readable documentation.
- **Prompt Engineering:** The core of Documenti's functionality lies in constructing effective prompts that provide the LLM with the necessary context and instructions to generate relevant documentation.

### Customizable Structure

- **Flexibility:** Documenti allows users to define the structure and content of their documentation through a `documentation_sections.json` configuration file.
- **Tailored Output:** This flexibility enables users to generate documentation that aligns with their specific project needs and preferences.

### Multi-Language Support

- **Accessibility:** Documenti supports generating documentation in multiple languages, making it accessible to a wider audience.
- **Locale Configuration:** The `language_processor.py` module handles language selection and updates the Starlight UI configuration to support the chosen languages.

## Architecture

Documenti follows a modular architecture, with distinct components responsible for specific tasks:

- **Codebase Parser:** Extracts relevant information from the codebase.
- **Documentation Processor:** Manages communication with the Gemini AI model and generates documentation content.
- **Gemini Client:** Handles interactions with the Gemini API.
- **Language Processor:** Facilitates multi-language support.
- **Starlight UI Integration:** Enables presenting the generated documentation in a user-friendly web interface.

## Design Principles

### Automation

- **Reduce Manual Effort:** Documenti strives to automate as much of the documentation process as possible, minimizing the need for manual writing.
- **Efficiency:** By automating repetitive tasks, Documenti allows developers to focus on other aspects of their projects.

### Simplicity

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Documenti provides a straightforward command-line interface, making it easy to use.
- **Clear Configuration:** The `documentation_sections.json` file offers a simple and intuitive way to define the documentation structure.

### Extensibility

- **Modular Design:** Documenti's modular architecture allows for future extensions and integrations with other tools or services.
- **Customizability:** The ability to customize the documentation structure and content provides flexibility for various project needs.

## Conclusion

Documenti embodies the principles of automation, simplicity, and extensibility in its approach to code documentation. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs and providing a user-friendly interface, Documenti aims to empower developers to create high-quality documentation with minimal effort.
