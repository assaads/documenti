## AI Agent

A software program that can perform tasks autonomously using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. In Documenti, the AI agent refers to the combination of the `Gemini Client` and the Gemini AI model, which work together to generate documentation content.

## API (Application Programming Interface)

A set of rules and specifications that define how software components or systems interact with each other. Documenti relies on the Gemini API to communicate with Google's large language models.

## API Key

A unique identifier used to authenticate and authorize access to an API. Documenti requires a Gemini API key to interact with the Gemini AI model.

## Codebase

The complete collection of source code files that make up a software project. Documenti takes a codebase as input and analyzes its structure and content to generate documentation.

## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

A text-based interface for interacting with a computer program. Documenti is a command-line tool, meaning users interact with it through a terminal or command prompt.

## Environment Variable

A dynamic-named value that can affect the way running processes will behave on a computer. Documenti uses environment variables to store sensitive information, such as the Gemini API key.

## Gemini AI

Google's suite of large language models, capable of understanding and generating human-like text. Documenti utilizes Gemini AI to generate documentation content based on code and section descriptions.

## JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. Documenti uses JSON for its configuration file (`documentation_sections.json`).

## Large Language Model (LLM)

A type of artificial intelligence model trained on a massive dataset of text and code, enabling it to understand and generate human-like text. Gemini AI is an example of an LLM.

## Markdown

A lightweight markup language used for formatting text. Documenti generates documentation in Markdown format, which can be easily converted to other formats, such as HTML.

## Module

A file containing Python code that defines functions, classes, and variables. Documenti's codebase is organized into multiple modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of the documentation generation process.

## Prompt

A set of instructions or a piece of text provided as input to a large language model. Documenti constructs prompts that include code information and section descriptions to guide the Gemini AI model in generating documentation content.

## Starlight UI

A user-friendly documentation UI that can be used to present the Markdown files generated by Documenti. It provides a web-based interface for browsing and searching the documentation.
