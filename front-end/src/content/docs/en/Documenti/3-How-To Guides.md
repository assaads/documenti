## How to Customize the Documentation Structure

Documenti allows you to tailor the structure and content of your generated documentation to suit your specific needs. This guide will explain how to customize the documentation structure using the `documentation_sections.json` file.

### Understanding the `documentation_sections.json` File

The `documentation_sections.json` file is a JSON configuration file that defines the sections and their order in your documentation. Each key in this file represents a section title, and the corresponding value is a description of that section. This description serves as context for the Gemini AI when generating documentation content.

### Modifying Existing Sections

You can modify the description of existing sections to provide more context to the AI. For example, if you have a section titled "API Reference," you can expand its description to specify which parts of the API should be documented:

```json
{
  "API Reference": "Detailed documentation of the public API, including classes, methods, and parameters, with a focus on usage examples and code snippets."
}
```

### Adding New Sections

To add a new section to your documentation, simply add a new key-value pair to the `documentation_sections.json` file. For instance, you could add a section for "Contribution Guidelines":

```json
{
  "API Reference": "Detailed documentation of the public API, including classes, methods, and parameters, with a focus on usage examples and code snippets.",
  "Contribution Guidelines": "Guidelines for contributing to the project, including coding style, branching strategy, and pull request process."
}
```

### Reordering Sections

The order of keys in the `documentation_sections.json` file determines the order of sections in your generated documentation. You can rearrange the keys to change the section order.

### Generating Documentation with the Customized Structure

After making changes to the `documentation_sections.json` file, re-run the `main.py` script. Documenti will generate documentation based on the updated structure and descriptions.

## How to Generate Documentation in Multiple Languages

Documenti supports generating documentation in multiple languages, expanding its accessibility to a wider audience. This guide will walk you through the process of generating multi-language documentation.

### Choosing Languages during Runtime

When you run the `main.py` script, you'll be prompted with the question: "Do you want to choose multiple languages (the default language is English)? (yes/no):". Enter "yes" to enable multi-language documentation generation.

You'll then be presented with a list of available languages. Select the languages you want to generate documentation for by entering their corresponding numbers separated by commas. For example, to generate documentation in English, Spanish, and German, you would enter "1,2,3".

### Language-Specific Output

Documenti will create separate directories for each selected language within the output directory. Each language directory will contain the same Markdown files as the English documentation, but the content will be generated in the corresponding language.

### Updating the Starlight UI Configuration

If you're using the Starlight UI to present your documentation, you need to update its configuration to include the selected languages. The `language_processor.py` script automatically handles this by modifying the `astro.config.mjs` file in the Starlight UI directory.

### Reviewing the Multi-Language Documentation

After the script finishes, you can review the generated documentation in each language-specific directory.

## How to Integrate Documenti with Starlight UI

Starlight is a user-friendly documentation UI that can be used to present the documentation generated by Documenti. This guide outlines the steps for integrating Documenti with Starlight.

### Copying the Starlight UI Directory

The `fe_builder.py` script is responsible for copying the Starlight UI directory to the parent directory of the Documenti project. This ensures that the UI is accessible for integration.

### Updating the Starlight Configuration

The `language_processor.py` script automatically updates the Starlight configuration file (`astro.config.mjs`) to include the selected languages for documentation generation.

### Building the Starlight UI

Once the documentation is generated and the Starlight configuration is updated, you can build the Starlight UI using the following commands within the Starlight UI directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

### Serving the Starlight UI

You can then serve the built UI using:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will start a local development server where you can access your documentation website.

### Customizing the Starlight UI

Starlight offers various customization options, such as theming and layout adjustments. Refer to the Starlight documentation for more details on how to personalize the UI.
