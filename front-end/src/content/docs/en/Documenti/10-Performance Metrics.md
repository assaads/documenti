description: Performance data and metrics for Documenti.
---

Currently, no specific performance metrics have been collected or documented for Documenti. 

Evaluating performance aspects like speed, memory usage, and load capacity would require systematic testing and benchmarking under various conditions. Factors influencing performance include:

- **Codebase Size:** Larger codebases will naturally take longer to parse and process.
- **Documentation Structure Complexity:** More complex documentation structures with numerous sections will lead to more interactions with the Gemini AI model.
- **Gemini API Response Times:** The responsiveness of the Gemini API directly impacts the overall documentation generation speed.
- **Hardware Resources:** The available CPU, memory, and network bandwidth on the machine running Documenti can affect performance.

Gathering and analyzing performance metrics would provide valuable insights into Documenti's efficiency and scalability. It would also help identify potential bottlenecks and areas for optimization.
