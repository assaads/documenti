Documenti, in its current implementation, does not expose any external APIs. It functions as a standalone command-line tool that processes codebases locally and generates documentation files. 

Therefore, there are no API endpoints to document in this context. 

However, Documenti relies on the Gemini API provided by Google for its core functionality of generating documentation content. 

## Gemini API

The Gemini API is a powerful cloud-based API that allows developers to interact with Google's large language models. Documenti utilizes the Gemini API to send prompts containing code information and section descriptions, receiving responses with generated documentation content.

### Authentication

- **API Key:** Authentication to the Gemini API is done using an API key, which should be stored securely as an environment variable (`GEMINI_API_KEY`).

### Request Format

The specific request format for the Gemini API varies depending on the model and task. In general, requests typically include:

- **Model:** The name of the Gemini model to use (e.g., `gemini-1.5-pro`).
- **Prompt:** The text prompt containing instructions and context for the model. In Documenti's case, this includes the codebase information and section descriptions.
- **Parameters:** Additional parameters can be specified to control the model's behavior, such as temperature, top_p, and max_output_tokens.

### Response Format

The response from the Gemini API typically includes:

- **Generated Text:** The text generated by the model based on the provided prompt and parameters.
- **Metadata:** Additional metadata might be included, such as the model's confidence score or any safety flags triggered.

### Example Request and Response

While the exact format is not shown in the Documenti codebase, a simplified example of a Gemini API request and response might look like this:

**Request:**

```json
{
  "model": "gemini-1.5-pro",
  "prompt": "Generate documentation for the function `calculate_sum`:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_sum(a, b):\n  \"\"\"Calculates the sum of two numbers.\"\"\"\n  return a + b\n```",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "max_output_tokens": 100
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "generated_text": "## calculate_sum\n\nThis function calculates the sum of two numbers.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `a`: The first number.\n- `b`: The second number.\n\n**Returns:**\n\nThe sum of `a` and `b`.",
  "metadata": {
    "safety_flags": [],
    "confidence": 0.95
  }
}
```

Please refer to the official Gemini API documentation for detailed information on request and response formats, available models, and parameters.
