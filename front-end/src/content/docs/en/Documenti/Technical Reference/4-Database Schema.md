title: Database Schema
description: Description of the database schema used in Documenti.
---

The Documenti project does not utilize a database. Its primary function is to parse codebases, interact with the Gemini AI model, and generate documentation files. All data processing and storage occur in memory or as files within the local file system. 

Therefore, there are no database tables, columns, or relationships to document in this context.
